INSTALL UNDER UNIX

  You need the ocaml compiler installed. It must be accessible in the path.

1. Choose which compilation mode "transitional" or "strict" (see the
   file "MODE") and do either:
     ./configure --transitional
   or:
     ./configure --strict

   The default is strict.

   To compile with jocaml, add option '--oname jocaml'.

   All other options of 'configure' can be displayed with its option --help.

2. Then, to make everything, do:
     make

   Faster compilation, in parallel, with option -j (see manual page
   of 'make', for information). For example, if you have a computer
   with 4 cores:
     make -j4

    Alternatively, you can decompose the operations into:
       make out
    Then, to make camlp5 check itself:
       make bootstrap
    Further, to make the native-code library:
       make opt
    At end, to make more native-code programs:
       make opt.opt

3. Become root and do:
     make install

INSTALL UNDER WINDOWS

  Under Windows, you need the Cygwin environment. The above directives
  apply.
