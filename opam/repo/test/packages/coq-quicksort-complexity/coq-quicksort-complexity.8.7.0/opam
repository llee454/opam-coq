description: """
The development contains:
- a set of monads and monad transformers for measuring a (possibly nondeterministic) algorithm's use of designated operations;
- monadically expressed deterministic and nondeterministic implementations of Quicksort;
- proofs of these implementations' worst- and average case complexity.

Most of the development is documented in the TYPES 2008 paper "A Machine-Checked Proof of the Average-Case Complexity of Quicksort in Coq", available at the homepage."""
