description: """
Fraenkel's proof of Schroeder-Bernstein theorem on decidable sets
is formalized in a constructive variant of set theory based on
stratified universes (the one defined in the Ensemble library).
The informal proof can be found for instance in "Axiomatic Set Theory"
from P. Suppes."""
