description: """
This development contains the set-as-pointed-graph
interpretation of Intuitionistic Zermelo Frankel set theory in system
F_omega.2++ (F_omega + one extra universe + intuitionistic choice
operator), which is described in chapter 9 of the author's PhD
thesis (for IZ) and in the author's CSL'03 paper (for the extension
IZ -> IZF)."""
