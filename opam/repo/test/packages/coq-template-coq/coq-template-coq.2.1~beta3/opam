synopsis: "A quoting and unquoting library for Coq in Coq."
description: """
Template Coq is a quoting library for Coq. It takes Coq terms and
constructs a representation of their syntax tree as a Coq inductive data
type. The representation is based on the kernel's term representation.

In addition to a complete reification and denotation of CIC terms,
Template Coq includes:

- Reification of the environment structures, for constant and inductive declarations.
- Denotation of terms and global declarations
- A monad for manipulating global declarations, calling the type
  checker, and inserting them in the global environment, in the style of
  MetaCoq/MTac.
- A partial type-checker for the Calculus of Inductive Constructions,
  runnable as a plugin.
- Example plugins built on top of this."""
