synopsis: "Ruler and compass geometry axiomatization."
description: """
This library contains an axiomatization of the ruler and
compass euclidian geometry. Files A1 to A6 contain the axioms and the
basic constructions. The other files build the proof that this
axiomatization induces the whole plane geometry except the continuity
axiom. For that the proofs of the Hilbert's axioms conclude this work in
the files E1 to E5."""
