description: """
This development treats proof search in intuitionistic propositional logic,
a fragment of any constructive type theory. We present new and more
efficient decision procedures for intuitionistic propositional
logic. They themselves are given by (non-formal) constructive proofs.
We take one of them to demonstrate that constructive type theory can
be used in practice to develop a real, efficient, but error-free proof
searcher. This was done by formally proving the decidability of
intuitionistic propositional logic in Coq; the proof searcher was
automatically extracted."""
