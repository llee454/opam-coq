synopsis:
  "Computing thousands or millions of digits of PI with arithmetic-geometric means"
description: """
This is a proof of correctness for an algorithm to compute PI to high precision
using an algorithm based on arithmetic-geometric means.  A first file contains
the calculus-based proofs for an abstract view of the algorithm, where all
numbers are real numbers.  A second file describes how to approximate all
computations using large integers.  The whole development can be used to
produce mathematically proved and formally verified approximations of PI."""
