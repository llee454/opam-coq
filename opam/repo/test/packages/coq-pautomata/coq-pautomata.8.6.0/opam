synopsis: "Parameterized automata."
description: """
This contribution is a modelisation in Coq of the p-automata
designed in the CALIFE project (http://www.loria.fr/calife).
It contains an axiomatisation of time,
the definition of a p-automaton, the definition of binary and
arbitrary synchronisation of a family of p-automaton, the semantics of
a p-automaton as a labelled transition system. The description of the ABR
algorithm as a p-automaton is also given.

This work is reported in : P. Castéran, E. Freund, C. Paulin and
D. Rouillard ``Bibliothèques Coq et Isabelle-HOL pour les systèmes de
transitions et les p-automates''"""
