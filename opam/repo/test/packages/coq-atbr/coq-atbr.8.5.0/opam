synopsis: "A tactic for deciding Kleene algebras."
description: """
This library provides algebraic tools for working with
binary relations. The main tactic we provide is a reflexive tactic for
solving (in)equations in an arbitrary Kleene algebra. The decision
procedure goes through standard finite automata constructions, that we
formalized."""
