synopsis: "Coalgebras, bisimulation and lambda-coiteration."
description:
  "This contribution contains a formalisation of coalgebras, bisimulation on coalgebras, weakly final coalgebras, lambda-coiteration definition scheme (including primitive corecursion) and a version of lambda-bisimulation. The formalisation is modular. The implementation of the module types for streams and potentially infinite Peano numbers are provided using the coinductive types."
