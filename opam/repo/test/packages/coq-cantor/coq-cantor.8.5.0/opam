description: """
This contribution contains data structures for ordinals
less than Gamma0 under Cantor and Veblen normal
forms. Well-foundedness is established thanks to RPO with status for
generic terms. This contribution also includes termination proofs of
Hydra battles and Goodstein sequences as well as a computation of the
length of the Goodstein sequence starting from 4 in base 2.

This work is supported by INRIA-Futurs (Logical project-team), CNRS
and the French ANR via the A3PAT project (http://www3.iie.cnam.fr/~urbain/a3pat/)."""
