synopsis: "Linear Temporal Logic."
description: """
This contribution contains a shallow embedding of Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL) based on a co-inductive representation of program
executions. Temporal operators are implemented as inductive
(respectively co-inductive) types when they are least (respectively
greatest) fixpoints. Several general lemmas,
that correspond to LTL rules, are proved."""
