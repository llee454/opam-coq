synopsis: "A definition of rational numbers."
description: """
Definition of integers as the usual symetric
completion of a semi-group and of rational numbers as the product of
integers and strictly positive integers quotiented by the usual relation.
This implementation assumes two sets of axioms allowing to define
quotient types and subset types. These sets of axioms should be
proved coherent by mixing up the deliverable model and the setoid model
(both are presented in Martin Hofmann' thesis)."""
