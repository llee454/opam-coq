description: """
This file contains a specification for dictionaries, and
an implementation using binary search trees. Coq's module system,
with module types and functors, is heavily used. It can be considered
as a certified version of an example proposed by Paulson in Standard ML.
A detailed description (in French) can be found in the chapter 11 of
The Coq'Art, the book written by Yves Bertot and Pierre Castéran
(please follow the link http://coq.inria.fr/doc-eng.html)"""
