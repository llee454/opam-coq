synopsis: "Krivine's classical realizability."
description: """
The aim of this Coq library is to provide a framework for checking
proofs in Krivine's classical realizability for second-order Peano arithmetic.

It is designed to be as extensible as the original theory by Krivine and to
support on-the-fly extensions by new instructions with their evaluation
rules."""
