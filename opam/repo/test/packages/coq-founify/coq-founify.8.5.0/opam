synopsis: "Correctness and extraction of the unification algorithm."
description: """
A notion of terms based on symbols without fixed arities is defined
and an extended unification problem is proved solvable on these terms.
An algorithm, close from Robinson algorithm, can be extracted from the
proof."""
