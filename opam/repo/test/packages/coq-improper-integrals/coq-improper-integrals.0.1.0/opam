synopsis:
  "Additions to the coquelicot library for handling improper integrals"
description: """
This package contains a few theorems whose use case was discovered when
making experiments, for instance in the pi-agm package.  These theorems
should probably integrated in coquelicot in the long run, but having this
package makes them easily available while waiting for any necessary cleanup
and discussion to happen."""
